ML Model to predict customer churn
## Objective:
==========
Develop a model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their usage patterns and demographics.

## Description:
============
Use a dataset containing customer information and usage data to train a model that can predict the likelihood of customer churn.

## Key Steps:
==========
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualize distributions of key features.
   - Analyze correlations between features.
   - Examine churn distribution.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features if necessary.
   - Perform feature selection to identify the most relevant features.

4. Model Selection and Training:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
   - Compare model performance.

5. Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning:
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

6. Implementing the Model in a Real-World System:
   - Save the trained model.
   - Deploy the model using a Flask web application for real-time predictions.
   - Monitor model performance and update as necessary.
